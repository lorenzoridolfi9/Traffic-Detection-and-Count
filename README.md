# Traffic-Detection-and-Count 🚗 🚛

##  This repository contains Computer Vision project files. In particular, Yolov8 has been applied for object detection tasks, which can create models that recognize cars, trucks, and other objects on the highway and monitor traffic by counting units passing by at a certain point.

## Resources 💎
The .mp4 video used to do detection and counting is available in my google drive at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MR0qf6GgHOVlcB59qc6Iw8vydiYvzB6n?usp=sharing), along with the code and the final .mp4 video obtained from the following project.

you can access the colab notebook containing the source code at the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UDXDHM_NAfgqgGEi2HjSY5h33yTHYiHf?usp=sharing).
